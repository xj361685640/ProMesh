-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.6
Changes and additions:
- Adjusted subset-assignment in ExtrudeLayers so that the longest edge is now
  deciding on the assignment.

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.5
Changes and additions:
- It is now possible to mark faces.
- Added Selection-Faces-MarkedFaces

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.4
Changes and additions:
- Added tools to buffer and to restore vertex coordinates:
  * CoordinateTransform-CoordinateBuffer-StoreVertexCoordinates
  * CoordinateTransform-CoordinateBuffer-RestoreVertexCoordinates
  Those tools are useful if one wants to alter subset-assignments but requires
  to transform the grid temporarily to do so.
- Added a tool
  * Subsets-AssignNewSubset
  which automatically chooses the subset index as #subsets

Fixes:
- ugx reading is now more robust regarding vertex specification.
- Fixed an issue in 'Remeshing-Polylines-SimplifyPolylines' where some vertices
  hadn't been removed even though they obviously should have been removed.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.3
Changes and additions:
- .tex export now sorts elements before writing the output. Subset-Names are
  now used to identify styles instead of subset indices.
  An optional style-file 'custom_promesh_style.tex' is now optionally included
  by the resulting .tex file. This allows users to override the default style
  on a per-subset basis.

- *.smesh files can now be loaded through File-&gt;Open. 'smesh' is a format defined
  by 'tetgen'.

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug which sometimes occurred in ExtrudeLayers when 'allow for tets and pyras'
  was enabled.
  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.2
Changes and additions:
- CTRL+RightMouseClick now selects the whole subset independent of the current
  selection mode.

Fixes:
- Undo was broken if multiple meshes were edited simultaneously. Now fixed.
- Fixed a bug which occurred in RasterLayers::remove_small_holes (win-crash)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.1
Changes and additions:
- After extrusion only the newly created rim elements (vertices, edges, faces)
  are now selected. In order to select newly created volumes, use Selection-ExtendSelection.
- Added Info-Tool: PrintSelectionDirection
- Tool Subset-AssignSubset now allows to assign selected vertices/edges/faces/volumes only
- RasterLayers now support a separate min-height for each layer

Fixes:
- FileIO_ASC now reads rows in reverse order, now matching the format specifications
- Fixed false offset of imported geometry from FileIO_ASC



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.0
Changes and additions:
- Now using Qt5
- Added a doxygen based help-framework with full scripting reference
- GUI rework: New style and improved usability of number input fields and log messages
- Enhanced Selection-Edges-SmoothPath with an adjustable normal-weight
- ProMesh now asks before deleting a mesh and also before closing the application.
- New tool CoordinateTransform-SlopeSmooth
- New tool GridGeneration-Objects-NewObjectFromSelection
- New tool GridGeneration-Objects-CloneObject
- New tool Remeshing-RemoveDoubles-RemoveDoubleFaces
- New tools Remeshing-Polylines-SimplifyPolylines and -SimplifySmoothedPolylines
- New tools Remeshing-Triangulation-ReplaceLowValenceVertices and -AdjustEdgeLengthExtended
- New tool Remeshing-Tetrahedra-ConvertToTetrahedra
- New tool Selection-SelectShortPolychains
- New tools Selection-Edges/Faces/Volumes-LinkedEdges/Faces/Volumes
- New tool Selection-Faces-InterfaceFaces
- New tools Selection-Vertices-SelectionKinks and -SubsetKinks
- Added read support for binary .stl files
- Added read/write support for ascii .vtu files
- Added file-log in $HOME/.promesh/log.txt
- Added verbosity flag to Remeshing/Tetgen/Tetrahedralize
- Added Scripts-Menu, which features entries to create and edit scripts.
- Removed 'Subsets-AdjustSubsetsForUG4' since it created too many subsets.
- Improved Delaunay-Refinement by adding support for circular-shells and off-centers.

Fixes:
- ToolBrowser now adapts to new/changed/erased scripts nicely.
- Zoom-in can now be performed until rounding-errors are visible.
  (distance to focus point is now considered too to compute near-clipping plane)
- Fixed special cases in delaunay-triangulation and delaunay-refinement used in
  Triangulate and Retriangulate
- Subsets-CopySubsetIndicesToSides: Subsets of lower dimension are now treated
  with a higher priority than subsets with higher dimension.
- Disabled strict subset inheritance. Edges created through splits or refinement
  will now be assigned to the subset of the orignial face.
- Fixed crash in Retretrahedralize
- CollapseEdge now also supports Pyramids and Prisms (note that new volume elements
  can only be created for some of the possible collapse-constellations)
- MergeVertices now handles quadrilaterals, prisms, and pyramids more gracefully.
  As also seen in CollapseEdge, there are collapse-constellations for which it is not
  possible to create new volume elements from affected prisms and/or pyramids.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.1.9
Changes and additions:
- Added Selection-Volumes-SelectSlivers, which selects flat tetrahedrons.

Fixes:

- Added new file menu entries: "Browse User Scripts" and "Refresh Tool Dialogs"
- Added methods for grid measurements (length, area, volume) in Info-Measurements
- Added support for automated generation of tools from ug's registry
- Added scripting support and automatic script-tool generation
- Added Selection-Faces-FacesByNormal

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  was called and a bad number of vertices was selected.
- Remeshing-ResolveSelfIntersections is even more robust now on 32bit systems.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.1.4
Changes and additions:

Fixes:
- ResolveSelfIntersections is now more robust in regard to rounding issues when
  resolving self-intersections of coplanar triangles.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.1.3
Changes and additions:
- Reworked tools in Remeshing-ResolveIntersections. It now features a new tool
  'ResolveSelfIntersections', which automates most processes. The old tools can
  be found in Remeshing-ResolveIntersections-Advanced.
  Nearly all intersection tools recieved a considerable speed-up.
  The new algorithms should be more robust.
- Added CoordinateTransform-TangentialSmooth, which prevents manifolds from shrinking
  during smoothing.
- Added Selection-SelectCreaseEdges
- Added File-Reload (shortcut F5)
- Added File-ReloadAll (shortcut Ctrl+F5)

Changes and additions:
- Added Remeshing-Orientation-FixFaceSubsetOrientations which fixes face orientation
  for each subset separately.

Fixes:
- Subsets-AssignSubset(-1) now ignores the specified subset name (avoids unnecessary
  error message)
- Fixed bug in ExpandLayers dialog: Large subset-indices can now be entered.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.1.1
Changes and additions:
- Marks can no longer be accidentially applied to faces.
- ugx now also stores subset-visibility (important for undo)
- scene-inspector-rclick-show/hide-all now works in reasonable speed.

- The current selection is now being stored in .ugx files, too.
- undo-files are now written to .ugx (containing the current selection)
- before undo is executed, a undo point containing the current selection is created
  (given that it changed since the last undo-point)
- The names of the subsets in the "markSH" subset-handler in the written ugx file
  were changed

Fixes:
- CoordinateTransform-&gt;Scale now scales around the selections center again.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in Remeshing-Triangulation-TriangleFill occurred in 3d geometries
  when triangles outside the remeshing region were in a completely different
  plane than the remeshing zone itself.
- Tetrahedralization now automatically removes vertices which are not connected
  to any edge or face. This was required since tetrahedralization may not terminate
  with such vertices present and since a user may have a hard time to find them
  (or to remember to remove them).



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.0.7
Changes and additions:

Fixes:
- ProMesh no longer crashes during Remeshing-&gt;MergeVertices (introduced in 4.0.5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.25

Changes and additions:
- Added Selection-&gt;Edges-&gt;EdgeSelectionFill
- Added Selection-&gt;Faces-&gt;FaceSelectionFill
- Added Selection-&gt;Volumes-&gt;VolumeSelectionFill

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.24

Changes and additions:
- 2d .ng import is now supported.

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.23

Changes and additions:
- Extended SelectLinkedFlatFaces. Degenerated and flipped vertices can now be traversed.
- Added Info-&gt;PrintSelectionInfo, which gives an overview over selected elements
- Added Info-&gt;PrintSelectionContainingSubsets, which prints a list of all subsets which
  contain selected elements.
- Updated tetgen to its latest version.
- Enhanced the tetrahedralize dialog (min dihedral angle, preserve none, preserve bnds, peserve all)

Fixes:
- tetgen errors are now redirected to the log-window (missing in some of the previous versions.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.22

Changes and additions:
- Added Selection-&gt;Vertices-&gt;UnconnectedVertices, which allows to select vertices
  which are not connected to other elements.
- Added Subsets-&gt;Separation-&gt;SeparateDegeneratedBoundaryFaceSubsets, which can be 
  applied after AdjustSubsetsToUG3 in order to separate subsets consisting of
  degnerated boundary faces.

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug in ExportToUG3 which could cause a crash.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.21

Changes and additions:
- Added right-click menu to scene-inspector, introducing
    * Show all subsets
    * Hide all subsets
    * Print subset contents
- Enhanced AdjustSubsetsForLgmNg: lgm-Surfaces are now assured to be manifolds.
- Added Subsets-&gt;Separate-&gt;SeparateIrregularManifolds.
- Number input now works with '.' instead of ','

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.20

Changes and additions:
- Two kinds of box-selection are now supported:
  1: All elements that cut the box.
  2: Only elements that lie completely in the box.
- Added icons for selection mode in the main toolbar.
- ExpandFractures: Subsets adjacent to expanded fractures are now better preserved.
- ExpandFractures: The specified width now relates directly to the width of the fracture.

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where some edges after a split may not have been properly selected.
- ExpandFractures: Normals are normalized again before using them to offset new fracture vertices.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 3.2.19

Changes and additions:
- Files can now be opened by dragging them on the ProMesh symbol or by double
  clicking them (At least on MacOSX).
- Added "recent changes" file.
- ExpandFractures2D/3D now expand fractures at the geometries boundary.
- ExpandFractures2D/3D now support special "neumann boundaries" for degenerated elements.
- Selecting an element with click-select now automatically selects the associated
  subset in the SceneInspector.
- Added a pivot to Objects and reworked Move, Scale and Rotate accordingly.
- AdjustSubsetsForUG3 now optionally removes all initially existing interface subsets.

Fixes:
- Fixed bug with jumping list in SceneInspector when visibility was changed.</pre> </div></div><!-- contents -->
